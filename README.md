# Optimizing Email Open Rates: A/B Testing Subject Line and Preheader Text Analysis

**Overview:**

This project analyzes the results of A/B testing conducted on email subject lines and preheader texts to determine the most effective combinations for maximizing open rates. The analysis utilizes Python to process the A/B test data, identify statistically significant differences between variations, and visualize the results.  The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving email marketing campaigns and increasing customer engagement.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key statistics such as open rates for each subject line/preheader combination and any statistically significant differences identified.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualizations (e.g., bar charts comparing open rates) and save them as PNG files in the `output` directory.  These visualizations provide a clear visual representation of the A/B test results.  The specific output files generated may vary depending on the data used.


**Data:**

The project requires a CSV file containing the A/B test data.  This file should be placed in the `data` directory and should include columns for at least the subject line, preheader text, and number of emails opened and sent for each variation.  A sample data file may be provided in the future.
